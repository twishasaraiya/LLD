## In Memory Cache

### Requirements
We have to do low level design for a Cache system. Cache that we will design will have to support following operations:
- Put: This will allow user to put a value against a key in the cache.
- Get: This will allow user to get the previously saved value using key.
- Eviction: Cache should also support removal of some key in case cache is full, and we try to add new key value.
